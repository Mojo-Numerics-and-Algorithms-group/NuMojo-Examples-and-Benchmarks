# Welcome to NuMojo Documentation

Thank you for exploring the NuMojo Library! This repository showcases various examples and benchmarks to demonstrate the capabilities of NuMojo.

For a deeper dive into the syntax and features of NuMojo, we recommend checking out the code examples in the `examples` notebook. While NuMojo is still evolving, we are committed to continuously updating the documentation to provide comprehensive information.

Feel free to delve into the examples notebook and benchmarks included here to enhance your understanding of the NuMojo Library and its functionalities.


## Documentation 
While not all functionalities are currently documented, we are working diligently to update them soon. In the meantime, please refer to [NuMojo Docs](./docs/README.md) for the available APIs.
