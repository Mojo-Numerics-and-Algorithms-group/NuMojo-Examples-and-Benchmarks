# NuMojo Examples & Benchmarks

This repository contains various examples and benchmarks showcasing the capabilities of the NuMojo Library.

For a better understanding of syntax and NuMojo capabilities, refer to the code examples in the `examples` notebook. Since NuMojo is still in its early stages, not everything may be well-documented; we will strive to update it as we progress.

Feel free to explore the examples notebook and benchmarks provided here to gain a better understanding of the NuMojo Library and its features.
